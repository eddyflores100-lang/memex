"""Deterministic parsing of natural references to recent local work.

A user who says "the other agent today that audited Agent Kickstart" is naming
two things a retrieval score cannot see: a time window and, sometimes, a
literal session or task identity. This module turns that phrasing into explicit,
testable signals, and defines the fixed score adjustments the shared session
recall path applies on top of them.

Everything here is pure. There is no model call, no service call and no clock
side effect that a caller cannot inject, so the same query plus the same
`now`/`tzinfo` always yields the same decision.

Deliberate boundaries:

* Adjustments only ever RE-RANK candidates that already carry independent
  lexical evidence. The single exception is a literal identity match, which is
  an identity lookup rather than a similarity judgement.
* An out-of-window candidate is demoted, never removed. An explicitly named
  older date becomes the window itself, so naming an older referent cannot be
  suppressed by newer work.
* Nothing here reports whether a session or task is running. Live state is a
  control-plane question and stored evidence cannot answer it.
